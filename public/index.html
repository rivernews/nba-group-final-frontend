      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

		<p>In the last decades, there is a trend in NBA that players become more versatile (Center and Power Forward like Draymond Green become more agile and good at dribbling and assisting, Point Guard like Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook become stronger and good at physical confrontation). Influenced by this trend, players in the league have generally become taller and stronger over time. To identify this assumption, we conducted several visualizations as above shows.</p>
